# PySpark Hands-on Activities

This project provides a series of hands-on notebooks that allow you to explore and experiment with PySpark. Each notebook contains different activities designed to help you learn and apply various concepts and techniques in PySpark.

## Project Overview

The project includes several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of PySpark, such as data manipulation, transformations, aggregations, and more. By working through these notebooks, you will gain practical experience with PySpark and its core features.

## Features

- **PySpark Notebooks**: A collection of notebooks that guide you through different tasks and concepts in PySpark.
- **Hands-on Learning**: A chance to work on real-world data and practice Spark operations and transformations.
- **Variety of Activities**: Explore diverse PySpark capabilities, from data loading and processing to machine learning models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (preferably version 3.6+)
- Apache Spark
- PySpark
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (for running notebooks)

### Installation

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/your-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Open the relevant notebook from the list in the Jupyter interface to begin working on the activities.

## Notebooks

Each notebook in this project is designed to cover specific tasks:

1. **Notebook 1: Introduction to PySpark**
   - Basic setup and operations with PySpark
   - Loading and viewing data

2. **Notebook 2: Data Transformations**
   - Exploring data transformation operations like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and others.

3. **Notebook 3: Data Aggregation**
   - Using groupBy, aggregation functions, and pivot tables

4. **Notebook 4: Machine Learning with PySpark**
   - Introduction to Spark MLlib for building machine learning models
